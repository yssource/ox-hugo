This is a single post. You do not need to set the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME=
property in here. But then you also lose the tag and property
inheritance, TODO state, etc. Org awesomeness.

This file will export the front-matter in YAML (because
=#+hugo_front_matter_format: yaml=). See [[file:post-toml.org]] that
exports that in TOML.

Here's the same link with description: [[file:post-toml.org][Post exported with TOML
front-matter]].

Here's an example with relative link to an Org file:
[[file:../images-in-content/post4/post4.org]].

-----

All of the above linked Org files *have to* export posts using
/per-file/ flow, and they *cannot be* page bundles or have slugs --- See
=ox-hugo= Issue #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/131][131]] for requirements for this basic cross-linking to
work as expected.
